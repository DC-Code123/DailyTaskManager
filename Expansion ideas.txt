1.Task Deadlines and Dates;
    -Add a due date or deadline for each task.
    -Show overdue tasks and sort tasks by date.

    -Allow users to set priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low) for each task.
    -Display and sort tasks by priority.

    -Add a description or notes field for more task details.

4.Search and Filter:
    -Implement search functionality to find tasks by name or keyword.
    -Filter tasks by state, priority, or date.

5.Edit Tasks:
    -Allow users to edit task names, descriptions, deadlines, or priorities.

6.Data Persistence Improvements:
    -Save and load tasks in a more robust format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    -Add backup/restore functionality.

7.User Interface:
    -Create a simple GUI using a library like Qt or wxWidgets.
    -Improve the console UI with colors and better formatting.

8.Recurring Tasks:
    -Support tasks that repeat daily, weekly, etc.
